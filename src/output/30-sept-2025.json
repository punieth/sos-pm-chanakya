Such a goal is laudable but can be interpreted in different ways,” the company argued. Sateliot explained that it would support regulations that mandate internationally recognized best practices for security. However, it urged the government to ensure that any security measures it employs “remain proportionate and do not create unnecessary barriers to the adoption of innovative technologies.” Sateliot supports the policy’s goal of establ"

The law requires companies developing these models to follow new rules on transparency, accountability, and risk management. It builds on recommendations from California’s AI Policy Working Group, which released a report earlier this year calling for enforceable safety standards. Importantly, the state&#8217;s legislature noted that voluntary commitments from AI developers create gaps in oversight. And SB 53 responds by converting these commitments into binding legal obligations.
